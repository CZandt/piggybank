                        Answer: Investments are ways to make your money grow. There are several types of investments, such as:
                        - Stocks: Owning a piece of a company, and hoping the company does well so your investment grows.
                        - Bonds: Lending your money to a company or government, and they pay you interest.
                        - Real Estate: Buying property and hoping its value increases over time.
                        - Savings Account: Storing money in a bank and earning interest. It's safe but may have lower returns.

                        Answer: Investing in stocks can potentially lead to higher returns, but it comes with risks. The time commitment varies:
                        - Long-term: If you buy and hold, you can wait many years for your investment to grow.
                        - Short-term: If you actively trade, it may demand daily attention.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        Answer: Investing in bonds is more stable but offers lower returns. Time commitment can be:
                        - Fixed-term: You lend money for a specific period and get paid when it matures.
                        - Indefinite: Some bonds have no set maturity date.

                    <div class="card-body">
                        Answer: Liquidity means how quickly you can access your money. Savings accounts are highly liquid because you can withdraw funds anytime. Real estate, on the other hand, may have lower liquidity because selling property can take time.
